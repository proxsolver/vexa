# the correct completion_reason; the meeting-api callback handler ignored
# the signal and wrote status='completed' regardless. This helper closes
# the silent class by inspecting the same fields the data showed:
#   - reached_active (from status_transition[]) → distinguishes 432 class
#   - duration_seconds (from start_time/end_time) → 30s threshold
#   - transcribe_enabled (from data) → opt-out for recording-only mode
#   - transcription_count (count(*) from transcriptions table)

            #       through _classify_stopped_exit. The classifier already
            #       distinguishes reached_active+segments→COMPLETED from
            #       not-reached-active→STOPPED_BEFORE_ADMISSION. The else
            #       branch's silent NULL bucket becomes structurally
            #       impossible.
            #   (2) failure_stage derives from meeting.status at write time,
            #       not from the bot's payload. The bot reports its own
            #       internal stage tracker which is stale on the catch path
            #       (FM-003).
            #

            # into transition_metadata.unknown_bot_reason so DATA can grep
            # for new vocabulary before it becomes the next FM-002.

# the synthetic test rig (`tests3/synthetic/`) drive the full lifecycle
# via pure HTTP callbacks without external platform dependencies (Zoom
# DOM, Meet WebRTC, Teams). Catches OSS-side regressions that only
# surface in callback orderings (e.g. Pack J coverage gap caught
# 2026-04-27 by real Zoom test — would have caught deterministically
# with this rig).
#
# Path is `/bots/internal/test/...` (not `/internal/test/...`) because
# the api-gateway proxies the `/bots/internal/*` namespace to
# meeting-api but does NOT proxy a top-level `/internal/*` path.
# Mirrors the existing `/bots/internal/callback/*` pattern.
#
# Gated by VEXA_ENV != "production" — endpoint returns 404 in production.
# Synthetic-test traffic must never reach prod meeting-api instances.
